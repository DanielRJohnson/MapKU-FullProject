We used the Agile story point method of calculating person
hours. The previous project's story points and hours are as follows:

~ = based on estimation

Project 1: 8 story points, ~42 hours

Project 2: 5 story points, ~30 hours

Project 3: 8 story points, 53.33 hours

From this data, We believe that project 4 will take about 60 hours.
Project 4 is an 8 story point project just like projects 1 and 3.
However, I believe that project 4 is a little bit more complicated
than the others. It is still on the same order of story points,
but will likely take slightly longer. 

So, our final estimate is 60 hours.
